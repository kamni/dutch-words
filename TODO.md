## Show document list

* [ ] User tracking

* [ ] Create Conjugation model
  * [ ] order -- relative to the sentence
  * [ ] A conjugation has a One-to-Many relationship with a word.
  * [ ] Conjugations are unique per word, not language/user/text, because
        sometimes conjugations are the same for different root words
  * [ ] include translations? or only on the word?
  * [ ] include user tracking

* [ ] Create WordDB model
  * [ ] Words should have an ordering, relative to the sentence
  * [ ] Add user tracking to conjugationdb, conjugationui
* [ ] Create WordUI model

* [ ] Create DocumentUIFull model

* [ ] Conjugations are tied to the sentences, not the words
* [ ] When importing 'words' into the database, make them a conjugation.
      We'll add a word later.
* [ ] move conjugations into their own file (fix init.py)
* [ ] change Word.root_word to Word.text
* [ ] remove common.models.config
* [ ] remove common.models.dev
* [ ] rename `language` field on Document to `language_code`
* [ ] mv `utils/languages.py` to `common`
* [ ] convert backend.words.models.words to use PartOfSpeechType from common
* [ ] convert all the conjugation enums into choices for conjugations

* [ ] Add document_port
  * [ ] DocumentJSONAdapter
  * [ ] DocumentAPIAdapter
  * [ ] DocumentDjangoAdapter

## Misc

* [ ] fix audio upload url
* [ ] replace instances of os.path with pathlib.Path

## Django Experiment

* [ ] Don't fetch audio until first time viewing word?
* [ ] Fix common models
* [ ] Audio adapter
* [ ] Tests for audio adapter


* [x] Stressed or unstressed conjugation (think Dutch pronouns)
* [x] Add examples per conjugation, not per word
* [ ] Adapter for audio
* [ ] Tests
* [ ] Adapters for working with Django ORM
* [ ] Ability to upload translation files -- linked to other document

## Editing UI

* [ ] UserSettings
* [ ] Users should only be able to see their own items
* [ ] Django or js framework? Or textual? or?
* [ ] Display untranslated sentences
* [ ] Create words when sentence is translated (if they don't already exist)
* [ ] Create user tracking when a conjugation is added
* [ ] Set status from the UI on conjugation

## Initialize Database

* [ ] Remove corpora collection and parsed words -- they're not interesting
* [ ] Remove corpora info in README
* [ ] Initialize database only creates a new database
* [ ] Tests for initialize database -- if Django, would be command

## Cleanup

* [ ] coverage
* [ ] lint
* [ ] mypy
* [ ] copyright checker

## Thoughts

Here's the flow that I'm thinking of:

Editing Mode:

1. Upload a file.
   1. The script creates a new, Unknown word for each word, unless the word
      already exists.
   2. If the word already exists, append the sentence to the word (if the
      sentence doesn't already exist.
   3. Pull down the audio file from gTTS for each sentence (max characters
      is 100, so may have multiple files)
2. You're taken to a reading file.
   1. Sentences are in light gray, black text.
   2. Click on the sentence to bring up an edit modal.
   3. The edit modal allows you to add one or more translations.
      Translations are a string pared with a known language code
3. You're taken back to the reading file. Words translated show up in colored
   backgrounds to indicate their status:
   1. white background, black text: learned
   2. lavender background, black text: learning
   3. light green background, black text: defined, but not added to learning
      rotation.
   4. orange background, black text: Unknown type.
4. You handle all Unknown words. Left-click to bring up an editing modal:
   1. Set the type -- multiple words are type "Expression" -- ctrl+click to
      select multiple.
   2. Add translations.
   3. When saved, backend gets gtts translations for all words.
   4. You will be able to play each individual word.
5. Back in the reading file, you can right-click words to change their status
   to 'learned' or 'start learning'. You can also change any known words to
   one of the others. Left click to bring up the edit page again.

Learning mode:

1. Iterate through words set for learning.
   1. Ordering based on when last seen -- interval method.
   2. Can set how many words to study per day.
2. Sentence practicing:
   1. See/hear foreign text, rearrange bubble words in primary language
   2. See/hear primary language text, rearrange bubble words in foreign language.
   3. Hear foreign text, type what you heard.
   4. Option to turn off seeing text in #1 and #2

Score for number of words you've learned

Store word -- are all of them user-related? No uneditable words?
Selected translations?
